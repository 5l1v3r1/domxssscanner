Learn more about the tool on the project's [about page](http://www.domxssscanner.com/info/about)

## TODOs
- make scan results in script.js work with jquery 1.7.1
- Check whether it's possible to have sub directories in templates dir, which worked in Django 0.96 but not in 1.2 (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1081949/differences-in-django-template-inheritance-between-0-96-and-1-0) or use a better template engine
