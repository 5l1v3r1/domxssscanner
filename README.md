## TODOs
- Make small sticky toolbar style form on top in content pages
- Check whether it's possible to have sub directories in templates dir, which worked in Django 0.96 but not in 1.2 (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1081949/differences-in-django-template-inheritance-between-0-96-and-1-0) or use a better template engine
